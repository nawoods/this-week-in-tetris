<h2>Classic Tetris Level Twelve</h2>

<p>CT12 is back for 2024, entering its fourth year of operations and its second organized by Pumpyheart. Uniquely for an online event, a $12 entry fee was introduced to allow compensation for the restreamers and schedulers. While the player pool was more limited as a result, 27 players across three tiers still participated (with the top tier containing 12 players, of course), leading to a successful tournament with the relaxed feel of a mid-tier CTWC Regional. The 12-start matches were best of three throughout the tournament with a level 36 killscreen, placing additional emphasis on pre-29 play.</p>

<p>Predictably, the two ranked players made the semifinals. The top four was rounded out by Wallbant, who was runner-up in the previous two iterations of CT12, and Winter. Wallbant made Noah work for it, capitalizing on an early topout to force a decider. Wallbant showed off a significant amount of killscreen play in game three, and though Noah's 1.4 meant that the game wasn't particularly close, Wallbant's performance was impressive enough to warrant a second look for the Premiere Poll. Winter's growing pains in her switch from tapping to rolling led to two early topouts and an easy victory for Coal in the other semifinal.</p>

<p>Dengler's pace demon habits got the better of him in the first game of the finals, missing an S-spin up high and topping out 60 lines in. He was able to right the ship afterward, though, taking advantage of a Coal pre-29 in game two and holding on for longer on the killscreen in a nailbiter of a decider. Noah Dengler is the fourth CT12 champion in as many tournaments, joining the ranks of Blue Scuti, Gerald Freeman, and Rapta.</p>
