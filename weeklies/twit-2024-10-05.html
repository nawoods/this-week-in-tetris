Grizzled Tetris veterans Tristop and Brodindamp are probably the two active players with the most storied history; both started playing in 2018, and despite taking breaks here and there, have remained at the top of the scene for a long time. What was also interesting about this match was Brodin’s approach to rolling; he used mostly DAS and hypertapping pre-29, and didn’t switch to rolling unless he was caught in a high dig or before the 29 transition.
<p></p>
In game 1, Brodin had about a three-tetris lead going into 19, but Tristop was able to catch back up with some efficient play on 19. By the time Brodin topped out on level 27 due to a drought, Tristop was already ahead and took game 1 with ease. Brodin had a scary dig early on in game 2 which forced him to switch to rolling early on, but he got out of it without too much trouble; this allowed Tristop to jump out to a 60k lead into 19, a gap which tripled into 29 as Brodin wasn’t able to play cleanly. Brodin’s board was a mess into 29- he tried to dig himself out of the situation immediately but wasn’t successful. Game 3 saw both players playing clean on 18, with Tristop holding again a five-digit lead into 19 which widened to a six-digit one on 19, as he got a 600k transition and 1.1 into 29. Brodin topped out on level 29 after two consecutive double flips rendered his board unsalvageable, as Tristop took the set in a sweep.

SV changed his controller pads out moments before this match, which seemed to affect his performance a lot. Feeling uncomfortable with them, he changed back to the original ones in game 3, but that couldn’t stop Allenbot from sweeping him.
<p></p>
SV’s controller struggles were evident early on in game 1, as he almost immediately got into a high dig and visibly struggled to get pieces across the board; repeated dig situations set him about 200k behind Allenbot at the 19 transition, and he topped out on level 23 as he never quite escaped a single dig. Game 2 saw SV a bit more in control on 18, as he kept pace with Allenbot throughout 18. Both players transitioned in the high 500k range but had bad boards going into 19, but were able to survive the ordeal; the match was still neck and neck into 29, but SV wasn’t able to keep his board clean after a few misdrops and he topped out on level 30. In game 3, Allenbot had a 100k lead on SV with an impressive 650k transition, and he maintained this lead into killscreen. A bar dependency caused Allenbot to top out on Level 32, leaving SV with 100k or so to chase down; however, one hung bar and a double flipped one later, SV, too, had topped out, handing Allenbot the game and the match.

A late night match for Dog, and not exactly an easy one either, as he faced Nek0, one of the Tetris scene’s fastest rising stars, in round 2 of CTM Masters.
Dog takes game 1 with ease; Nek0 was in the lead most of the game, until he stacked too aggressively towards the 19 transition with no burn options and topped out at 106 lines. Dog had a 100k chasedown and completed it without too much trouble. Nek0 similarly outpaced Dog on 18 in game 2, but spent most of early 19 digging out of a messy board, giving Dog the chance to jump out to a lead into 29. Nek0 had a bad board into killscreen, but managed to clean it up; Dog topped out on level 34 after a drought caused his board to climb too high. Nek0 chased down the 200k, though not without drama- he hung a bar, double flipped a second one and managed to get a third one down the well for the winning Tetris. In Game 3, Dog paced incredibly pre-killscreen, getting 1.2 million into 29 to Nek0’s 1 million as the latter got into several digs. Nek0 went into 29 with a clean board but hung a bar right afterwards, causing him to top out and giving Dog the win. Game 4 saw several droughts on 18, but both players kept pace with each other and transitioned in the mid-500k range. Some digging for Nek0 let Dog take a 2-tetris lead into 29, but Dog went all in on a center well tetris and a misdrop screwed up his board in the process, when Nek0 was already ahead. Faced with the pressure of a decider, it was Dog who took a 100k lead into 19, but he wasn’t able to keep his board clean early on in 19 and allowed Nek0 to catch back up. The game was neck-and-neck into the killscreen, as both players began stacking for tetrises; Dog was able to play more efficiently and already jumped out to a 200k lead when Nek0 topped out after going too aggressive for a tetris on level 37. Dog’s pop off at the end of the match showed how close of a match this was- Nek0 is definitely one to watch after his great performances in the last few months.

<h3>Semis & finals</h3>

<p>
This month’s CTM Masters finals took on a different tone with the happenings of the day before. Dog’s two-hour Rebirth run, his first overall score world record, began a new chapter in Tetris history; the next day, he was back playing in CTM, looking for his ninth CTM Masters win. Most notably, both semifinals matches were rematches from CTWC- Blue Scuti and Tristop played in the Top 8 this year, while Dog and Dengler faced each other in the 2024 semifinals and 2023 Top 8.

Fourth time’s the charm seems to be the running theme in these finals, as Scuti finally overcame his 0-3 record against Tristop in the semis with his first win of the day.
<p></p>
Tristop had a very efficient pre-killscreen game 1, transitioning at 620k and with a 1.2 into 29, being ahead of by as much as 100k Scuti throughout that time. However, the killscreen is where Scuti truly shines, as Scuti was able to overcome the 100k deficit by the time Tristop topped out due to multiple double flips on Level 33. The story was reversed in Game 2 as Scuti was the one who had the lead into 19 and 29, although Tristop was hot on his heels as both players traded leads at various points before 29. After Scuti topped out as his stack spired early on 29, Tristop was already within a tetris’s distance, and he successfully chased down the score. Game 3 saw both players get into a few digs pre-killscreen, with Tristop slightly ahead of Scuti throughout that. However, Tristop took a high-ish board into 29 and double flipped a bar he meant to put in the tetris well, which instantly ended his game, and Scuti handily chased down the 40k needed to win the game. Tristop’s pre-killscreen efficiency was again on show in game 4, as he had his second 1.2 into 29 of the match, almost 200k ahead of Scuti. Some over-aggressive placements and a J-dependency caused his board to spiral immediately on 29 and top out, and Scuti chased down the points needed knocking down tetris after tetris.

Riding the high of his Rebirth run from the night before, Dog put up a monster performance against Dengler, who had plenty of shining moments.
<p></p>
Dengler’s pre-29 efficiency was on show in game 1 as he had a six-digit score lead at the 19 and 29 transitions, despite getting into some digs on 19. 29 play is the real difference in tournaments, though, and after throwing too many pieces to the right, Dengler had to deal with a ravaged board on killscreen; he attempted to dig his way out, hitting a clip-worthy 11 high 5 tap to the left, but just could not survive as he topped out three levels later. Game 2 followed a similar pattern with Dog behind Dengler for most of the pre-29 stretch. Dog had a huge J-dependency early in 29 which caused a huge spire, but he was able to take it down calmly; Dengler was then faced with a similar situation two levels later, but a misjudged O to the right, thinking that he’d burn a line, caused him to top out instantly, leaving Dog with 150k to chase down, which he did banging down tetrises and mullening to a rollover. Knowing that everything was on the line, in Game 3, both players dialed up their aggression, Dengler with a 710k transition and Dog about a tetris behind; they kept it up with level 24 maxes and Dengler getting a 1.3 into 29. However, 29 was again where things turned around; Dengler topped out after a long bar drought on level 31, and he could only watch as Dog chased down the 50k needed to sweep the match and mullened to his second rollover of the set.

Again, fourth time’s the charm for Scuti, as he finally won his second title after coming second in May, July and August, twice against Alex T and once against Sidnev.
<p></p>
Both players kept pace with each other in game 1, with Dog roughly a tetris behind Scuti into 19 and the same 20k margin persisting throughout post-transition, as both players were able to play efficiently with 1.1s into 29. The combination of a few dependencies high up the board and a long bar drought, however, caused Dog to top out soon after he transitioned into 29, by which time Scuti was already ahead. (He proceeded to dig himself out of an extremely messy board and mullen all the way to 39.) In game 2, untimely bars and dig situations meant that both Dog and Scuti had a slow start to the game, transitioning in the low 400k range and both hitting 29 with less than a maxout. Both players turned the heat up on 29 though, and when Dog topped out late on level 38, Scuti was still 80k behind and had to play perfect to win- so he did, winning this game with a narrow 14k difference. A short dig on 18 in game 3 caused Dog to fall about 60k behind Scuti at the 19 transition, but he caught back up and both players were quite close in score at the 29 transition. Scuti took a high messy board into 29 and proceeded to clean it up without breaking a sweat, while Dog actually pulled ahead by the time both players were on level 36; but as Dog covered his well a piece before the long bar comes and hung the bar to the left, there wasn’t anything he could do since Scuti had already pulled ahead and sealed his victory.
