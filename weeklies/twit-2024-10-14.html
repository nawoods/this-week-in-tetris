<h3>Masters Green Bracket</h3>

<p>
This was a special bracket to witness- four players who are all, arguably, rising stars; none have won CTM Masters before, or even made the semis (top 4) in the past, and have only become more prominent/well-known in the last few months.

Despite getting swept, Aussie player GalaxyBiscuit made a solid impression in his Masters debut, with no early topouts, healthy into-29 pace and many a memorable digs (and facial expressions!). He doesn’t have much 29 playability yet but it’ll be interesting to see how he progresses in the next few months.
<p></p>
Game 1 saw Galaxy get into several scary situations on 18 and 19; he survived all of them, but that put him 100k behind Meme at transition and about 60k behind into 29. Unfortunately he missed a tuck once he got to the killscreen and his board spiraled out of control quickly, topping out when Meme was already ahead. In Game 2, both players had healthy transition scores going into 19 and 1.1s into killscreen, keeping pace with each other all the way. But Meme’s 29 consistency was what won her the game, as Galaxy hung two bars to the left and topped out soon after the 29 transition. Game 3 followed a similar pattern as Game 1- Galaxy got into digs that Meme didn’t pre-killscreen, setting him 100k behind going into 29. He got a tetris on 29 but wasn’t able to set up for more before he topped out, losing in a sweep.

Coal and Neko are among the fastest-rising players in the Tetris scene right now, and they certainly lived up to the hype in this five-game set, putting up some big scores and tense pace throughout.
<p></p>
Game 1 saw Coal pull into a small lead into 19 and widen that to almost 100k with a 1.1 million going into 29, as Neko had some untimely misdrops that forced him to dig at certain points. Neko was able to score a decent amount before he was greeted with a drought right as he created a long bar dependency, and soon topped out after an effort of digging himself out. Coal mullened this game out and was just a single away from a rollover when he topped out at level 37.
<p></p>
Coal again had a commanding lead in game 2 going into 19 and 29 as he got another high 1.1 into 29; Neko getting into a couple of digs pre-29 put him over 200k behind as he entered the killscreen. Both players scoring on 29 efficiently meant that Neko still had that big deficit when Coal topped out due to a misdrop on level 33; with not that many lines to go, Neko dialed up his aggression and chased over half of it down before he faltered on a 5-tap and topped out 100k short.
<p></p>
The tides turned in Neko’s favor in game 3; both players had a strong start to the game with Coal slightly behind on 19, but Coal got into a multi-level dig on 19 that set him even further behind as he entered the killscreen 100k behind Neko, who was the one with the 1.1 into 29 this time. No lead is guaranteed when both players are able to score tetrises on 29; Neko once again falls to a long bar drought, leaving Coal with a 180k chasedown. He got half way through before a misplaced J covered his well and he topped out, handing Neko his first game of the set.
<p></p>
Both players paced intensely in game 4, with 600k plus transitions and 1.1 into killscreen; Coal had a big lead on 18 as he transitioned with a 693k, but he slowed down a bit on 19 and Neko caught up to him. With no long bar in sight, Coal had no choice but to take a high board into 29 and almost immediately topped out; Neko was already ahead by that point and forced a decider.
<p></p>
The final match was anticlimactic after the deep runs in the first four games; Neko had a huge spire on 18, delayed filling in a dependency, and his board began to climb. One hung L piece later he was done just 51 lines in, and Coal would advance to the next round.

Game 1 was a monster performance from both Coal and Meme, featuring a double rollover. Both had healthy paces going into the killscreen- 600k transitions and (almost in Meme’s case) 1.1s into 29- but Meme taking a couple of burns before 29 set her back 50k or so into killscreen, when this game really kicked into action. But both of them were able to continuously score tetrises on 29, meaning Meme couldn’t make up the deficit at all despite putting up 549k in post-post to a rollover; Coal already had a 1.7 and took this crazy double rollover game.
<p></p>
Coal and Meme were neck and neck all the way in game 2 as they traded the lead back and forth. Coal had a small lead into 19 but slowed down a bit, but both were good for maxouts into the killscreen. Every time either player tetrised they would take the lead, and this situation continued until Coal topped out as some less than ideal pieces didn’t let him dig his way out.
<p></p>
Game 3 was a true 29 chasedown for Meme; she was behind all through 18 and 19, as Coal had his third 600k transition of the set and continued to have a two-tetris pace lead into 29. Meme’s incredible 29 play meant that she was already able to make up that deficit when Coal topped out on Level 32 as his stack got too high, mullening to a second rollover in this second win.
<p></p>
Unfortunately we got another anticlimactic ending when Coal suffered an early topout at 40 lines after he hung a J to the left, cutting off access to column 1 and handing Meme her ticket to the semifinals. Still, this was an impressive performance by both players, especially in their confident killscreen play. It’s impossible to get to the top these days without some good 29 play ability; these two players definitely have it in the bag.

Despite winning a game when he outplayed TetrisTime pre-29 and the latter couldn’t chase down the score, DAS player Anpu still couldn’t overcome the roller, as TetrisTime pretty much stomped over him in the other three games.

Poke had a difficult first two games where he couldn’t stay clean pre-29 and struggled to get a 29 going. His confidence was back in Game 3 when he mullened to a 1.3, carrying over to a strong showing to reverse sweep O.

Rahmations' last-minute CTL registration was especially timely given his rank in the Premiere Poll has been slipping due to inactivity, having been absent since his fourth place at MinneD.  Although he put up a respectable fight against Dengler in Gauntlet, another chance to prove that it was a pattern, not a fluke (on a bigger stage) can’t hurt. He’s challenged by veteran Jerpi, who returns to competition for the first time since CTWC 2024, coupling this set with a stab at CTM Challengers. Her one-handed roll grip continues to mesmerize and confuse, including caster roncli who is bewildered at her killscreen play after thinking she was playing DAS (or thortapping).
<p></p>
The set itself is a little less exciting than the stories of its competitors. Rah throws down hefty 19 and 29 transition scores; although he tops out immediately on the killscreen, Jerpi doesn’t do much better and fails to chasedown the difference between their pre-29 scores. She then early tops the subsequent two games before 65 lines, perhaps showing her rust in getting 5 taps to the left. Rahmations takes the set in a sweep, his mullen topping out on level 24 doesn’t help punctuate things.

Dog is trying to pull away from the pack of Sidnev, Myles and Tristop as his rebirth run puts the current Tetris order into question. His run to the finals in Masters although fell short, was hardly disappointing stat-wise (1.473m FMS!) still kept Scuti as the tentative #1 in a lot of people’s eyes. New-look Coalbucket himself is attempting to push into the top 15, with all the momentum in the world. 
<p></p>
Game 1 certainly lived up to these lofty expectations: a double rollover. Both were pacing hard; but Coal just paced harder through 18, throwing down a near 700k transition and pushed hard for the 1.3 into-29, even pulling off 2 delayed VITSes to max on 24, at one point amassing a 200k+ lead. Dog seemed content to let his killscreen play do the work, because whilst Coal had to deal with a perpetually messy board from squeezing out every last point from the slower speeds, dog just piled on the points as the level scaled his tetris values. Coal absolutely did not let up, but even when he rolled over, dog had already done so in fewer lines. He knew the mission. Dog would mullen another 100k to put up a spooky high 1.7 million. Roncli has said he felt the momentum already slipping away, and Coal, seemingly winded couldn’t manage a maxout in the following 2 games, even after a 100k lead at transition in game 3. Dog made his supremacy known by mullening out another 1.7 million by pacing hard through the killscreen.

Alex marks the end of his well-deserved break from competition (excluding a tapover in Basement Battles and gaunlet) by returning to CTL. It’ll be an important season in proving he deserves his spot at #1 after a handful of pollsters felt his defeat to Scuti was convincing. iBall also took September off, and with the top 10 being so competitive his games, especially against rising star Nek0, will be ones to watch.
<p></p>
Huh. Alex cannot get into scoring position on the killscreen and an empty left spells the end. iBall coasts to a 1 game lead. They trade leads of less than 2 tetrises throughout game 2, until level 36 where a dig up high for Alex puts him in a 4 tetris deficit that his 29 aggression doesn’t repay. In fact, it just looks like recklessness that makes him top out. And whilst iBall also tops out on level 31 due to a spire, his pre-29 cleanliness gives him a 2 game lead. Filled with confidence, iBall goes shirtless. Alex says in chat he wants too also, but its too cold and he needs to keep his sweater on. That was his first mistake. Shirtless iBall, unanswered too, gives off a dangerous aura and Alex tops out at 91 lines. In an elimination game. A man with the highest Masters F19% of 96.7%. Alex said he wasn’t warmed up — and maybe that, in combination with the rust of a break and the expectations of a return meant losing in a sweep, and not a pretty one at that. It’s enough for the almighty Ryan Hamburger to bump him below Scuti and Dog at third on his power rankings.
